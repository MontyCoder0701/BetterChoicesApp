# BetterChoicesApp
First app I made in Swift!  
This is to mainly help people with BPD to record their choices with thought-out processes.  
You can see the list of Impulses you felt, and when you recorded them.  
Each Impulse record can be viewed and edited freely!  

## Disclaimer 
For security reasons and personal data protection (regarding the nature of this app),  
I will not be saving any data in any form of external database.  
This means all data is saved in the local storage of the device.  
If the app is deleted, all data cannot be recovered.  

## Features
### Add an Impulse
Write down your Impulse, Pro (what you gain from doing it), Con (what you lose from it).

### Add your Rules
Add your own BPD Rules that you should keep (like decision making, FPs ...)


### Give yourself Positive feedback
Press the heart every time you managed to stop yourself from acting on that impulse.  
Or you can use it to record how many times you felt that impulse.  

## Issues & PRs
This is my first Swift app, so I know it has a lot of problems.  
Feel free to post Issues or PRs  about how you would like to improve this app.
