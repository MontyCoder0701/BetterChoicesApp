# BetterChoicesApp
First app I made in Swift!  
This is to mainly help people with BPD to record their choices with thought-out processes.  
You can see the list of Impulses you felt, and when you recorded them.  
Each Impulse record can be viewed and edited freely!

Press the heart every time you managed to stop yourself from acting on that impulse.  
Or you can use it to record how many times you felt that impulse.  

## Issues & PRs
This is my first Swift app, so I know it has a lot of problems.  
Feel free to post Issues or PRs  about how you would like to improve this app.
